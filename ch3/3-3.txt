>|| Exercise 3.3
>|| States the consequences of hd and tl evaluating to [] when given [] as input

If tl returned [] on an empty list input it would be impossible to distinguish between a list with 1 element (excluding []) and one with none
i.e.

tl [1]
=> []

tl []
=> []

If hd returned [] on an input of [] it would be ambiguous with lists of lists starting with []
i.e.

hd [[], [1,2]]
=> []

hd []
=> []
